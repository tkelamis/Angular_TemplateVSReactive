# Angular's Template Driven and Reactive Forms

This project demonstrates the differences of a simple sign up form in which a template-driven approach is used than the same form with the use of reactive form functionality. It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
